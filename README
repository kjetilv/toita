A playground project with many things going for it:

 - Scala-based
 - Lift-based!
 - Comet-based!!
 - Does Twitter, with JSON, User Streams and OAUTH!

Some things it don't got going for it:

 - Totally a playground project with no production-like qualities whatsoever

Use at your own risk, and against my advice.

Oh, and you need an OAUTH key and secret to even do anything.  I didn't check
those in.
